# The familiarity bias

In the world of product development, people are obsessed with simplicity.
Buzzword.
We are lacking common definitions.

Everything thinks what they are doing is simple.
Because it is simple _to them_.

The inability to let go of our own POV is what is blocking us down.

We need forced functions to help us get rid of our own bias.

If its simple to you but not to your teammates -> what knowledge are they missing to turn it into something simple ?


What feels 'good' 'bad' -> software instinct ? craftsman instinct ?

A lot of IC work is about transmitting this ?
